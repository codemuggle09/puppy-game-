# Perfect Puppy Fit

A simple drag-and-drop game where you fit a puppy into its outline.

## How it works
* Drag the puppy to fit the pink outline
* Volume changes based on how close you get (closer = louder)
* Volume buttons don't work (they're broken)

## The point
It's intentionally frustrating - the volume controls look important but do absolutely nothing. The volume only changes when you move the puppy.

## Files
Just one HTML file. Open in any browser to play :)
